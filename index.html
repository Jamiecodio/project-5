    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <article>
      <p> I grew up in Washington, DC, and went to college at Virginia Tech, where I experienced living in the mountains and got to know people that live and work there. After college I moved back to DC and started working for nonprofits. I then got a masters degree in Public Administration from George Mason University, a reputable school that attracts students from all over the country for its academics and being close to DC. </p>

      <h3> Blog Post</h3>
      <article>
        <p> I have worked for nonprofits and public relations firms throughout my entire career since graduating from college in 2004. I enjoyed the meaningful work for the nonprofits and their missions, and I enjoyed the challenges of working in public relations. I spent over 6 years working for Qorvis Communications, and then in 2021 I was laid off due to Covid reduction.</p>
        <p> Due to the difficulty of finding a follow up job at a nonprofit or PR firm, I accepted a job as Assistant Manager at Loyal Companion, a boutique pet supply store for dogs and cats, and went back into retail for the first time since I was still in college. I learned a lot at the pet supply store and was able to apply a lot that I had learned in obtaining a certification in Digital Marketing.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Loyal Companion ending going out of business and Ihave trouble rebuilding my career since then. This is what brought me to Correlation One and sparked my interest in coding. I have learned how to incorporate headings, images, colors, and design lists, to name just a few of the skills I have picked up in this class. I hope to be able to form a career working for Amazon, one of my favorite companies that offers access to all kinds of books, movies, kitchen products, you name it Amazon has got it.</p>
